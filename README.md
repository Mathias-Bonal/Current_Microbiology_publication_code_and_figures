R Code that led to the figures put in my publication in Current Microbiology

The R files are scripts used to create Fig. 2, 4, 5, S1, S2 and S3. 

plots_cultures is the script used to create Fig. 2 and S1-2-3.

Pearson_correlation_tests is the script used to create Fig. 4.

barplots_mu_K is the script used to create Fig. 5.

Excel files are to be used in each corresponding script (see details in R code).
